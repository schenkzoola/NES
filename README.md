Schematics for the NES

When researching how the NES works, the schematics I've found all seem to be inaccurate in one way or another.

In this schematic, I've used the other schematics as a guide, and have validated the connections with a multimeter.  I've also included reference designators and pin numbers.

What hasn't been included yet is the RF modulator.
