# NES
## NES-001 Console

When researching how the NES works, the schematics I've found all seem to be inaccurate in one way or another.
In this schematic, I've used the other schematics as a guide, and have validated the connections with a multimeter.  I've also included reference designators and pin numbers.
What hasn't been included yet is the RF modulator.

## HVC-001 Console

These are schematics for the Famicom HVC-001.  I mostly verified my NES-001 schematics against the official scheamtics and verified anything that didn't match.

## Cartridges

Using the same process as the console, I created schematics to document the various cartridges I've come across.
These are sorted by their PCB names.

## Errors

If you find any issues with the schematics, please create a github issue, and I'll look into it.
