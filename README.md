# NES
## Console

When researching how the NES works, the schematics I've found all seem to be inaccurate in one way or another.
In this schematic, I've used the other schematics as a guide, and have validated the connections with a multimeter.  I've also included reference designators and pin numbers.
What hasn't been included yet is the RF modulator.

## Cartridges

Using the same process as the console, I created schematics to document the various cartridges I've come across.
These are sorted by their PCB names.
